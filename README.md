### Links

- Live Site URL: [Frontend Mentor IP address tracker](https://pawel-gnat.github.io/Frontend-Mentor-IP-address-tracker/)

## My process

I used ip-api | pro instead of IP Geolocation API by IPify, because I found better free version. It has just free endpoint limited to 45 requests per minute. I connected 2 APIs (second is leaflet.js) by recursion.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I used ip-api | pro instead of IP Geolocation API by IPify, because I found better free version. I implemented very basic error handling. I did this task within 5 hours and I really enjoed it. It was clearly something else from static website examples.
